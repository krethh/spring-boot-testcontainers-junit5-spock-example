## spring-boot-testcontainers-junit5-spock-example
Rudimentary project with a Testcontainers setup, testing simple REST endpoints.
Examples in pure JUnit5 and Spock.

On running `mvn clean test` a Postgres container should be created and integration tests in JUnit and Spock should successfully complete (Docker must be running).
